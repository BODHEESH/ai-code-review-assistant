## 1. Project Overview

The AI Code Review Assistant is an innovative platform designed to provide developers with AI-generated code reviews. Users can submit their code in various programming languages and receive detailed feedback, enhancing code quality and promoting best practices.

### Key Features:
- User authentication and registration using Firebase
- Intuitive code submission interface
- Integration with an AI-powered code review API
- Real-time updates and storage using Firebase Firestore
- Responsive and animated UI for enhanced user experience

## 2. Architecture

The project follows a modern client-server architecture, leveraging the following components:

1. **Frontend**: Built with Next.js, providing a responsive and interactive user interface.
2. **Backend**: Utilizes Next.js API routes and Firebase services for server-side logic.
3. **Database**: Firebase Firestore for real-time data storage and synchronization.
4. **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication for secure user management.
5. **External AI Service**: An AI-powered code review API for analyzing submitted code.

## 3. Key Components

### Frontend

#### Sign-Up Page (`/pages/signup.js`)
- Handles user registration using Firebase Authentication
- Implements form validation for email and password
- Stores user details in Firestore upon successful sign-up

#### Code Submission Page (`/pages/home.js`)
- Allows users to submit code, specify language, and add descriptions
- Communicates with the `/api/chat` API route for code review
- Displays AI-generated reviews and stores them in Firestore

### Backend

#### API Route (`/api/chat`)
- Processes code submission requests
- Communicates with the external AI code review service
- Returns AI-generated reviews to the frontend

### Authentication

Firebase Authentication is used for:
- User registration
- Login and logout functionality
- Session management

### Firestore Database

The database schema includes:
- `users` collection: Stores user information
- `threads` collection: Contains code submissions and associated reviews

## 4. APIs

### Code Review API

Endpoint: `/api/chat`

Functionality:
- Receives code submissions from the frontend
- Forwards code to the external AI service
- Retrieves and returns AI-generated reviews

Example API Payload:
```json
{
    "question": "function add(a, b) { return a + b; }",
    "isCodeReview": true,
    "language": "JavaScript",
    "description": "This function adds two numbers."
}
```

## 5. Libraries and Tools Used

- **Next.js**: React framework for building the user interface and API routes
- **Firebase**: Authentication and Firestore database
- **Framer Motion**: Animations for enhanced user experience
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for responsive design
- **Toastify**: User notifications and alerts
- **React Hooks**: State management and side-effect handling

## 6. How to Set Up the Project

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14.x or later)
- npm or yarn
- Firebase project with Authentication and Firestore enabled

### Setup Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ai-code-review-assistant.git
   cd ai-code-review-assistant
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up Firebase:
   - Create a Firebase project in the Firebase Console
   - Enable Email/Password Authentication
   - Create a Firestore database

4. Configure environment variables:
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with your Firebase configuration:
   ```
GROQ_API_KEY = ""
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY= ""
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN= ""
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID= ""
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET= ""
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID= ""
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID= ""
   ```

5. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## 7. Deployment

The project can be deployed using Vercel or any other hosting provider that supports Next.js applications. Follow the hosting provider's documentation for specific deployment instructions.

## 8. Future Enhancements

Consider implementing the following features to improve the AI Code Review Assistant:

- Support for multiple programming languages
- Integration with version control systems (e.g., GitHub, GitLab)
- User dashboard for viewing past submissions and reviews
- Collaborative features for team code reviews
- AI-powered code suggestions and auto-fixing capabilities

## 9. Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions:

- **Firebase Configuration Errors**: Ensure all environment variables are correctly set in the `.env.local` file.
- **API Connection Issues**: Check the external AI service status and verify API keys.
- **Firestore Permissions**: Verify Firestore security rules to ensure proper read/write access.

## 10. Conclusion

The AI Code Review Assistant provides a powerful platform for developers to receive instant, AI-powered code reviews. By leveraging modern web technologies and cloud services, it offers a seamless, responsive, and efficient user experience. This documentation serves as a comprehensive guide for setting up, understanding, and potentially extending the project.
